# Sensei by WooThemes

**A learning management plugin for WordPress, which provides the smoothest platform for helping you teach anything.**

Sensei is a commercial plugin available from http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/. The plugin is hosted here on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike. If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it here (following the guidelines below). We do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the website. We cannot provide support or one-click updates to anyone that does not hold a valid license key.

##Contributing to Sensei

Please be sure to follow the guidelines below while contributing:

- When opening an issue please keep it to one bug / enhancement / question etc. this to simplify the discussion.
- All code contributions must be in the form of a pull request.
- All pull requests must be related to an existing / new issue.
- The general rule is to use 1 PR for 1 Issue. This helps the merge master quickly figure out how the new code affects the plugin.
- Going forward we will prefer it if all PR's also include the PHPUnit tests.
